# Silver Cubes: Computational Investigation Findings

## Background

A **silver (n, d)-cube** is a triple `(K_n^d, I, c)` where:
- `K_n^d` is the d-th Cartesian power of the complete graph on n vertices (the "Hamming graph" on `[n]^d`).
- `I` is a *diagonal* of `K_n^d`, i.e., a maximum independent set (cardinality `n^{d-1}`).
- `c : V(K_n^d) -> {0, 1, ..., d(n-1)}` is a vertex coloring such that for every `v ∈ I`, the closed neighborhood `N[v]` contains every color exactly once (rainbow).

This investigation focuses on the **d = 3** case. We use the *back-circulant* diagonal
`I = {(x, y, z) : x + y + z ≡ 0 (mod n)}`.

The Ghebleh, et al. paper conjectures
silver `(n, 3)`-cubes exist for every n ≥ 1 and proves a multiplicativity theorem: if silver (m, 3)- and (n, 3)-cubes exist, then so does a silver (mn, 3)-cube. The conjecture therefore reduces to the prime n case. The paper constructs silver cubes for n ∈ {2, 3, 5}
and cites Ventullo-Khodkar for n = 7. The smallest
open prime in 2008 was **n = 11**, with n ∈ {13, 17, 19, …} also open.

The silver (11, 3)-cube file is at
`silver_z2_n11_h16x6_cadical.txt`; the silver (13, 3)-cube file is at
`silver_z13_n13_h13x11_cpsat.txt`. Both are verified by the script
`verify_cube.py`. (KV note: I also verified these through a script I wrote by hand (!)). 

## Methodology

### 1. Direct SAT encoding (failed for n ≥ 7)

Variables: one Boolean `x[v, c]` per (cell, color) pair.
Constraints: exactly-one-color per cell; for each w ∈ I, all-different
over N[w].

This works for n ≤ 5 (under 2 seconds) but stalls past 10+ minutes for n = 7
without further structure.

### 2. Biased-multiplicity ansatz (key breakthrough)

Each color's multiplicity on I, call it `a_c`, is constrained by
Proposition 2.1 of the paper: `a_c ≡ n^{d-1} (mod d)`, i.e., for d = 3,
`a_c ≡ n^2 (mod 3)`.

Fixing a *specific* multiplicity distribution (e.g., 5 colors used 7 times
each + 14 colors used once each = 49 = 7^2 for n = 7) drastically tightens
the SAT instance. Doing this:
- Reduced n = 7 from "10+ minutes no result" to **18 seconds**.
- Was independently the recollection of K. Ventullo regarding his
  original 2007 search.

### 3. Z/2 negation equivariance (key for n ≥ 11)

The back-circulant diagonal is preserved by negation `(x, y, z) -> (-x, -y, -z)`.
A coloring is **Z/2-equivariant** if `c(-v) = σ(c(v))` for some involution
σ on colors. Origin is σ-fixed.

For n = 11 with the (16 × 6 + 1 × 25) distribution and Z/2 equivariance, the
search took **71 minutes** of CPU; cadical found a satisfying assignment.

The σ used: heavy colors paired (0↔1), (2↔3), (4↔5); light colors paired
(7↔8), (9↔10), ..., (29↔30); the σ-fixed color is 6 (= color of origin).

### 4. Z/2 with σ-fixed multiplicity > 1 (silver_z2_v2.py)

Extension for n with no Z/2-compatible distribution at σ-fixed mult 1.
For each candidate (h_p, m, m_f), one needs:
- h_p × m = (n² - 2·l_p - m_f) / 2 where h_p + l_p = (3n - 3) / 2.
- h_p, l_p ≥ 0.
- m ≡ n² mod 3.
- m_f odd, m_f ≡ n² mod 3.

This was tried at n = 13 with 5 distinct candidate distributions × 2 SAT
solvers (cadical + kissat); none succeeded in ~10 hours wall × ~6 hours
effective CPU each.

### 5. Order-n translation equivariance (key for n = 13)

The Z/2 approach treats the diagonal multiplicity distribution as a free
parameter to be guessed and swept. A stronger ansatz removes that freedom
entirely by demanding equivariance under a **cyclic group of order n** of
diagonal-preserving translations, generated (for n = 13) by

```
tau : (x, y, z) -> (x + 1, y + 1, z - 2).
```

A coloring is `H`-equivariant if `c(tau·v) = rho(c(v))` for a fixed color
permutation `rho`. Counting forces `rho` completely: it must be **two
n-cycles plus (n - 2) fixed colors**. The fixed colors then each own a
full `H`-orbit of the diagonal (n collinear points), and the cycled
colors each own a single diagonal point. For n = 13 this gives the
distribution `(13 × 11) + (1 × 26)` — *forced*, not guessed; it is exactly
the "canonical, non-Z/2-compatible" distribution of Open Question 2 below
that the earlier sweeps could not crack.

Two facts make this work where direct/Z/2 search stalled:

- **A clean reformulation.** Index the diagonal by `(x, y)`. Each
  off-diagonal cell `w = (x, y, z)` with defect `s = x + y + z ≠ 0` is
  adjacent to exactly the three diagonal cells
  `{(x, y), (x - s, y), (x, y - s)}` — a "corner triple". A silver cube is
  then equivalent to a proper `(3n - 2)`-coloring of the intersection
  graph of these `n²(n - 1)` triples (two triples adjacent iff they share
  a point); the diagonal color at each point is *forced* to be the unique
  color missing from the 3n - 3 triples through it. Under `tau`, triples
  carry tidy orbit coordinates that make the forced `rho` and the n ≡ 1
  (mod 3) restriction provable rather than empirical.
- **Symmetry breaking.** The equivariant model still admits ~10^10
  trivial relabelings (permuting the n - 2 fixed colors, rotating each
  n-cycle, translating the whole picture). Pinning these canonically — fix
  the two cycle "holes" to specific diagonal cosets and assign the i-th
  remaining coset to fixed color i — collapses that redundancy and is the
  single decisive step. Without it the model ran 30+ CPU-hours with no
  verdict; with it, OR-Tools **CP-SAT** returned `OPTIMAL` in ~6 hours.

The resulting cube is in `silver_z13_n13_h13x11_cpsat.txt`. Its structure
is the opposite of the n = 11 cube's: where n = 11 is "amorphous" with
only a Z/2 mirror, n = 13 is **n-fold periodic by construction** — color
classes are unions of `tau`-orbits, with diagonal spectrum 11 × 13 + 26 × 1.

This route is intrinsic to **primes p ≡ 1 (mod 3)** (which includes 7 and
13): the forced color spectrum exists only then. For p ≡ 2 (mod 3), e.g.
n = 11, the order-p translation ansatz is provably infeasible (the
encoding returns UNSAT), which is exactly why n = 11 required the Z/2 +
guessed-distribution route instead. The two primes sit on opposite sides
of a genuine mod-3 dichotomy rather than reflecting a difference in search
luck.

A further refinement: demanding the order-n translation **and** the Z/2
negation simultaneously (dihedral group of order 2n) is also satisfiable
at n = 13, giving a cube directly comparable to the n = 11 mirror
structure. Here the single σ-fixed color is one of the heavy
(full-coset, multiplicity 13) colors, versus the light (multiplicity 1)
σ-fixed color at n = 11.

## Structural Analysis

We enumerated 50 distinct *diagonal-color patterns* of silver (7, 3)-cubes
under the (7 × 5 + 1 × 14) distribution and tested whether any classical
combinatorial structure recurs.

**All of these tests returned essentially 0 of 50** or 0 of 250 heavy-class
instances:

- Heavy color classes on affine lines in (Z/7)².
- Heavy color classes as partial permutations (transversals).
- Heavy color classes as conic sections (quadrics).
- Light cells forming 2 affine lines (= 14 cells).
- 5 heavy classes as mutual translates of a single tile.
- Multiplicative symmetry: `(x, y) -> (αx, αy)` preserving heavy partition.
- Quasi-invariance under any of:
  - all 48 non-identity translations preserving I
  - all 5 non-identity coordinate permutations
  - negation
  - 6 combined negation × axis-swap involutions (V₄, D₆ family)
- Sidon (distinct-difference) structure on heavy classes.
- Light cells as a D₇-orbit.
- Triple structure (each heavy class' 14 non-I cells produce 14 triples
  partitioning the other 42 I-cells; these triples are not Steiner-system-like
  and have multiple distinct "shapes" per heavy class).

We also checked the n = 11 winning cube for symmetries beyond the Z/2 we
enforced. The only non-trivial cube symmetry it has is negation (= scaling
by α = 10 mod 11 = -1).

**Conclusion**: silver cube solutions appear *structurally amorphous*. No
clean algebraic recipe parameterizes them.

## Lovász Local Lemma Attempt (failed)

We attempted a non-constructive existence proof via LLL.

Random model: pin the diagonal coloring with the chosen multiplicity
distribution. Then color each non-I cell uniformly from
"allowed" colors = {0..3n-3} minus the 3 colors of its I-neighbors.
Bad events: "for w ∈ I and pair (u, v) ⊂ N(w), c(u) = c(v)".

- Probability bound: p ≤ 1/(q - 6) = 1/31 for n = 13.
- Dependency degree: d ≤ 18n - 25 = 209 for n = 13.
- LLL condition: e · p · (d + 1) ≤ 1.
- Computed value: 2.718 × (1/31) × 210 ≈ **18.4**.

The basic argument fails by a factor of ~18. The constants are inherently
bad because each non-I cell participates in O(n) bad events while each
bad event has probability O(1/n). Cluster-expansion or asymmetric LLL is
unlikely to close an 18× gap.

This is consistent with the structural amorphousness: silver cubes appear
to live just at the "phase transition" boundary where probabilistic
arguments do not work easily.

## Open Questions

1. **Does a silver (13, 3)-cube exist?** *Resolved: yes.* The earlier
   ~80 CPU-hours of Z/2 + distribution-sweep search failed not because
   the object is absent but because that approach left both a large
   distribution space and ~10^10-fold color-relabeling symmetry; the
   order-13 translation ansatz with symmetry breaking (Method 5) found
   one in ~6 CPU-hours. File: `silver_z13_n13_h13x11_cpsat.txt`.

2. **Is there a non-Z/2 distribution at n = 13 that admits a silver cube?**
   *Resolved: yes — it is the winning one.* The "canonical" distribution
   (m = n, k_h = n - 2) = (13 × 11 + 1 × 26), Z/2-incompatible because
   k_h = 11 is odd, is exactly the distribution *forced* by order-13
   translation equivariance. It is not merely admissible; under that
   symmetry it is the only possibility.

3. **General theorem**: the Ghebleh et al. conjecture (silver cubes exist
   for all n ≥ 2) remains open for primes n ≥ 17. The translation-
   equivariant construction now gives 7 and 13 (both ≡ 1 mod 3) by the
   same mechanism, suggesting a possible uniform construction for all
   primes p ≡ 1 (mod 3) — the natural next target is n = 19. Primes
   p ≡ 2 (mod 3), starting at n = 11, provably fall outside this
   mechanism and appear to need a genuinely different (non-equivariant
   or larger-group) idea.

## Practical Pipeline (what worked)

For a silver (n, 3)-cube at prime n with n² ≡ 1 mod 3 (which includes 11, 13, ...):

1. Pick a multiplicity distribution `(h_mult × k_h + 1 × k_l)` satisfying
   Prop 2.1 (`h_mult ≡ 1 mod 3`).
2. If k_h is even and k_l is odd, the distribution is Z/2-compatible. Use
   the Z/2 encoder.
3. Sweep over candidate `(h_p, m, m_f)` triples that are structurally
   close to the n = 11 winner (h_p = 3, m = 16, m_f = 1):
   - keep h_p small (~3),
   - keep m moderate (~n),
   - increase m_f as needed for divisibility.
4. Use a SAT solver (cadical or kissat) with the seqcounter encoding for
   at-most-one cardinality constraints.
5. Run in parallel across distributions and solvers; first to finish wins.

For n ≤ 11 this pipeline finishes in under 90 CPU-minutes per successful
case. It did **not** succeed for n = 13 (~80 CPU-hours); n = 13 was
instead solved by the order-n translation-equivariant route (Method 5),
which is the recommended approach for primes p ≡ 1 (mod 3).
